# Predictive Maintenance with CommonSense & Sony Spresense

## The challenge

One of our clients has a Xerox iGen4 machine in its print shop. Some common problems with Xerox iGen4 print machines include paper jams, toner issues, and printer errors. These problems can cause the machine to fail and result in lost production. Additionally, these problems can also be safety hazards if they are not fixed. The air quality in a print shop can be dangerous because of the chemicals used in the printing process. 

## The solution

We have chosen the Sony Spresense development board paired with the CommonSense expansion board to monitor vibrations and air quality by being placed directly inside the print unit in key points where they could detect issues and report them in real-time.

## Conclusion

The solution presented above allows you to schedule maintenance before the problem occurs, instead of waiting for something to break. Additionally, predictive maintenance can improve safety by identifying potential hazards before they cause an accident. In our case detecting unusual vibrations in the printer and solvents or ink leaks can keep the workers safe and the workflow uninterrupted.
